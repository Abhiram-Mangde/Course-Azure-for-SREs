# Capstone Project: Azure SRE End-to-End Challenge

## Overview
This capstone project is designed to test and showcase all the skills you have learned throughout the 8 modules. You will architect, deploy, automate, secure, monitor, and optimize a real-world Azure solution, simulating the responsibilities of a Site Reliability Engineer.

---

## Project Scenario
You are hired as an Azure SRE for a startup launching a web application. Your task is to build a reliable, secure, and cost-effective cloud environment using Azure. The solution must be automated, observable, and ready for scale.

## Requirements
1. **Design & Architecture**
   - Draw or describe the architecture: resource groups, networks, VMs, storage, security, monitoring, CI/CD, cost controls.
2. **Resource Deployment**
   - Create a Resource Group and Virtual Network with subnets for web and database tiers.
   - Deploy at least two VMs (web servers) in an Availability Set.
   - Set up a Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
   - Create a Storage Account for logs and backups.
3. **Automation**
   - Use Bicep/ARM/Terraform to automate resource deployment.
   - Set up Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline to deploy a sample web app.
4. **Security**
   - Configure NSGs and Azure Firewall.
   - Enable MFA and assign RBAC roles.
   - Set up Azure Security Center and review Secure Score.
5. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Enable Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
   - Create dashboards and set up alerts for key metrics.
   - Run a stress test and analyze logs.
6. **Cost Management**
   - Set a budget and configure alerts for cost overruns.
   - Review and optimize resource usage.
7. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Enable Azure Backup for VMs and demonstrate a restore.
8. **Documentation & Presentation**
   - Document your architecture, scripts, pipelines, dashboards, and decisions.
   - Prepare a short presentation or video walkthrough of your solution.
