# Why SREs Need to Understand Networking

Networking is the invisible backbone of every cloud service. For Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), mastering networking is essential because it directly impacts reliability, performance, and security in Azure environments.

## Key Points
- Connectivity issues = service outages
- DNS misconfigurations = widespread failures
- Load balancing = high availability
- Firewalls & NSGs = secure workloads

## Real-World Example
An SRE troubleshooting a VM outage discovers the root cause is a blocked NSG rule — not the application itself. Networking knowledge saves hours of downtime.

## Conclusion
Networking is not optional for SREs. It’s a core skill that ensures systems are reliable, scalable, and secure.
