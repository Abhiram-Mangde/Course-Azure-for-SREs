# About This Course: Azure for SREs

Welcome to **Azure for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)** — a practical, hands‑on course designed to help you master reliability engineering in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

---

## Why This Course Matters
<div class="highlight-box">
Modern systems run at massive scale, and keeping them reliable is one of the hardest challenges in technology today.  
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines <strong>software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and operational excellence</strong> to ensure systems stay available, performant, and secure.
</div>

Azure is one of the world’s leading cloud platforms. By learning how to apply SRE principles in Azure, you’ll gain skills that are directly relevant to real‑world jobs in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Reliability Engineering.

---

## Who Should Take This Course
- **Beginners** curious about cloud computing and reliability.
- **Junior SREs or DevOps engineers** who want to level up with Azure.
- **Students and career changers** seeking portfolio‑ready projects.
- **IT professionals** who want to understand reliability patterns in cloud environments.

<div class="highlight-box">
No prior cloud or SRE experience is required — we start from fundamentals and build up to advanced practices.
</div>
