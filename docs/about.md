Welcome to **Azure for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)** — a practical, hands‑on course designed to help you master reliability engineering in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

---

## Why This Course Matters
<div class="highlight-box">
Modern systems run at massive scale, and keeping them reliable is one of the hardest challenges in technology today.  
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines <strong>software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and operational excellence</strong> to ensure systems stay available, performant, and secure.
</div>

Azure is one of the world’s leading cloud platforms. By learning how to apply SRE principles in Azure, you’ll gain skills that are directly relevant to real‑world jobs in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Reliability Engineering.

---

## Who Should Take This Course
- **Beginners** curious about cloud computing and reliability.
- **Junior SREs or DevOps engineers** who want to level up with Azure.
- **Students and career changers** seeking portfolio‑ready projects.
- **IT professionals** who want to understand reliability patterns in cloud environments.

<div class="highlight-box">
No prior cloud or SRE experience is required — we start from fundamentals and build up to advanced practices.
</div>

---

## What You’ll Learn
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Understand core Azure services** and how they support reliability.
- **Deploy, monitor, and manage resources** using best practices.
- **Automate infrastructure** with tools like Terraform, Bicep, and GitHub Actions.
- **Implement observability** with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights.
- **Apply reliability patterns** such as autoscaling, load balancing, and disaster recovery.
- **Secure and optimize costs** while maintaining performance.
- **Build portfolio projects** that demonstrate your skills to employers.

---

## How You’ll Learn
- **Hands‑on labs** to practice real deployments.
- **Incident simulations** to think like an SRE during outages.
- **Community discussions** where learners share experiences and solutions.
- **Capstone projects** that tie everything together.
