Welcome to **Azure for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)** — a practical, hands-on course designed to help you master reliability engineering in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

---

## Why This Course Matters

<div class="docs-callout">
Modern systems run at massive scale, and keeping them reliable is one of the hardest challenges in technology today.  
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines <strong>software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and operational excellence</strong> to ensure systems stay available, performant, and secure.
</div>

Azure is one of the world’s leading cloud platforms. By learning how to apply SRE principles in Azure, you’ll gain skills that are directly relevant to real-world roles in **DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Site Reliability Engineering**.

---

## Who Should Take This Course
- **Beginners** curious about cloud computing and reliability
- **Junior SREs or DevOps engineers** looking to level up with Azure
- **Students and career changers** seeking portfolio-ready projects
- **IT professionals** who want to understand cloud reliability patterns

<div class="docs-callout">
No prior cloud or SRE experience is required. The course starts with fundamentals and gradually builds toward advanced practices.
</div>

## What You’ll Learn
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand **core Azure services** and how they support reliability
- Deploy, monitor, and manage resources using best practices
- Automate infrastructure using **Terraform, Bicep, and GitHub Actions**
- Implement observability with **Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights**
- Apply reliability patterns such as **autoscaling, load balancing, and disaster recovery**
- Secure environments and optimize costs without sacrificing performance
- Build **portfolio-ready projects** to showcase your skills

---

## How You’ll Learn
- Hands-on labs with real Azure deployments
- Incident simulations to think like an SRE during outages
- Community discussions to share experiences and solutions
- Capstone-style projects that tie concepts together

---
