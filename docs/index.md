# 🚀 Azure for SREs  
### *Build • Operate • Scale Reliable Systems on Microsoft Azure*

> A **practical, real-world course** designed to help you think like a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** while working with **Microsoft Azure**.

---

## 🌟 Why Azure for SREs?

Most courses teach *what Azure services do*.  
Most SRE content teaches *theory without context*.

**This course combines both.**

You will learn **how systems fail in production**, **why they fail**, and **how SREs design Azure architectures that survive failure**.

✔ Production-first mindset  
✔ Beginner-friendly, no assumptions  
✔ Focused on reliability, not just deployments
