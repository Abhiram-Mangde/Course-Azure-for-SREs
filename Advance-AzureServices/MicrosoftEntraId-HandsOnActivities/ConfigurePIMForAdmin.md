# Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Global Admin Role

## What is Privileged Identity Management (PIM)?

**Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** is a service that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. These include:

- **Azure AD roles** (e.g., Global Administrator, User Administrator)
- **Azure resources** (e.g., Subscriptions, Resource Groups)

With PIM, you can:
- Enforce **just-in-time (JIT)** role activation
- Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for elevation
- Set **approval workflows** before granting privileges
- Limit **activation duration** for sensitive roles
- Implement **audit and alerts** on role usage

### Why Use PIM for Global Administrator?

The **Global Administrator** role has the highest level of privilege in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). Assigning this role permanently increases the risk of:
- Accidental configuration changes
- Account compromise
- Non-compliance with security policies

**PIM helps mitigate these risks** by making the role **eligible** instead of permanent, and requiring users to **activate** the role only when needed â€” with appropriate **controls**.
