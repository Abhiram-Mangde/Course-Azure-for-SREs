# Course-Azure-for-SREs
Getting Started with Azure &amp; SRE

## Module 1: Getting Started with Azure & SRE

Lesson 1.1 ‚Äì What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet. Instead of buying expensive hardware and maintaining it in data centers, companies rent these resources from providers like Microsoft Azure.
Example: Instead of buying your own server for hosting a website, you can create a Virtual Machine in Azure within minutes and pay only for the hours you use.
Three main service models:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Renting servers, storage, or networking.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Renting both servers and software platforms (like a ready-made environment for deploying apps).
SaaS (Software as a Service): Using complete software over the internet (like Microsoft 365 or Gmail).
üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Show a simple analogy ‚Äî buying vs. renting a house. Renting = Cloud. Buying = On-premise.

Lesson 1.2 ‚Äì Why Choose Azure?
Microsoft Azure is one of the leading cloud platforms used by enterprises worldwide. Many multinational companies run their workloads on Azure because:
It integrates well with Microsoft tools (Windows, Office, Teams).
It has global availability (data centers in multiple regions).
It offers strong security and compliance features.
üëâ Highlight: For freshers and SRE beginners, learning Azure opens career opportunities in IT operations, cloud engineering, and site reliability roles.

Lesson 1.3 ‚Äì Who is an SRE?

SRE stands for Site Reliability Engineer. Think of it as a mix between a software engineer and a system administrator. The SRE‚Äôs main job is to keep systems reliable, scalable, and efficient.
They ensure systems don‚Äôt crash.
They build tools to automate repetitive tasks.
They set targets like uptime (e.g., "Our app must be available 99.9% of the time").

üëâ Beginner-Friendly Example: Imagine you‚Äôre running an online shop. If your website goes down, you lose money. An SRE ensures the shop is always online and fast.

Lesson 1.4 ‚Äì Azure Portal Walkthrough & Free Account
In this lesson, we‚Äôll log in to the Azure Portal for the first time.

Step 1: Go to portal.azure.com
Step 2: Sign up for a Free Account (Microsoft gives $200 free credits).
Step 3: Explore the dashboard ‚Äî Resource Groups, Virtual Machines, Networking, and Storage.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Record your screen while creating a free Azure account and exploring the main menu. Keep it simple and slow-paced.

## Module 2: Core Azure Services for Every SRE

Lesson 2.1 ‚Äì Understanding Resource Groups & Subscriptions

In Azure, everything you create‚Äîlike virtual machines, networks, or storage‚Äîis organized inside Resource Groups.

Subscription: Think of it like your "wallet" in Azure. It defines billing and access.

Resource Group (RG): A logical container to group related resources. For example, if you‚Äôre running a project called E-commerce App, you could place the web server, database, and network inside a single Resource Group.

üëâ Analogy: Subscription = your bank account. Resource Group = your shopping bag.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Show creating a Resource Group in the Azure Portal. Then deploy a simple resource (like a Storage account) inside it.

Lesson 2.2 ‚Äì Networking Basics in Azure (VNet, Subnet, IPs, Security Groups)

Networking is the backbone of cloud infrastructure. In Azure, the key concept is the Virtual Network (VNet).

VNet: Like a private network inside Azure.

Subnet: A smaller section of that VNet. For example, one subnet for web servers, another for databases.

IP Addresses: Every resource gets an IP (public = internet-facing, private = internal).

NSG (Network Security Group): Works like a firewall. You define which traffic is allowed in/out.

üëâ Beginner Example: Imagine an office building. The building = VNet. Each floor = Subnet. Security guard at the door = NSG.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Create a VNet and two Subnets in the Azure Portal. Show how to restrict access using an NSG.

Lesson 2.3 ‚Äì Creating and Managing Virtual Machines (Hands-On Lab)

Virtual Machines (VMs) are the foundation of cloud computing. They act like computers running inside Azure.

You can choose the operating system (Windows/Linux).

You can scale them up or down (CPU, RAM).

You pay per hour/minute of usage.

üëâ SRE Note: Many companies run critical applications on Azure VMs, and SREs must manage their performance, scaling, and reliability.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube:

Create a simple Linux VM in the Azure Portal.

Connect via SSH.

Show basic monitoring (CPU usage in Azure metrics).

Lesson 2.4 ‚Äì Storage Essentials (Blob, Disk, File Shares)

Azure Storage provides multiple ways to save data:

Blob Storage: For files like images, videos, logs.

Disk Storage: Disks attached to VMs.

File Shares: Like a shared network drive, accessible by multiple machines.

üëâ Beginner Example: Think of Azure Storage as a library.

Blob = books stored randomly in shelves.

Disk = book attached permanently to one person.

File Share = multiple people borrowing the same book.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Upload a file (e.g., image) into Blob Storage and access it via a public link.

Lesson 2.5 ‚Äì Identity and Access Management (Azure AD & RBAC)

Security is crucial in any IT role. In Azure, access control is managed by Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Azure AD: Central directory for users, groups, and devices.

RBAC: Defines "who can do what." Example: An admin can create resources, but a developer may only view them.

üëâ Analogy: Azure AD is like your company‚Äôs employee list. RBAC is their job title/permission level.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Create a user in Azure AD and assign them "Reader" role on a Resource Group. Show that they cannot delete resources.

‚úÖ At the end of Module 2, learners will know how to:

Organize resources properly.

Build networks securely.

Deploy and manage VMs.

Store data effectively.

Control access and security.

This forms the foundation every SRE must know before tackling reliability, automation, or observability.

## Module 3: Observability Made Simple
Lesson 3.1 ‚Äì What is Monitoring & Why It Matters for SREs

Monitoring is the practice of checking the health of systems in real time. As an SRE, your job is not just to keep systems running but to know when something is going wrong before users notice.

Observability means you can "observe" what‚Äôs happening inside a system by looking at logs, metrics, and traces.

Three pillars of observability:

Metrics ‚Äì numbers like CPU usage, memory, response time.

Logs ‚Äì detailed event records (errors, warnings).

Traces ‚Äì how a request flows through different services.

üëâ Analogy: Think of observability like a car dashboard.

Speedometer = metrics.

Error lights = logs.

GPS tracking = traces.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Show a VM running in Azure, then open its built-in monitoring dashboard with CPU and memory graphs.

Lesson 3.2 ‚Äì Azure Monitor Basics (with Demo Dashboards)

Azure Monitor is the central tool for collecting and analyzing performance data.

It collects data from VMs, apps, and resources.

You can visualize data with charts and dashboards.

You can set up alerts (e.g., notify when CPU > 80%).

üëâ Beginner Example: If your website slows down, Azure Monitor shows CPU or network spikes, helping you diagnose the problem.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube: Create a simple Azure Monitor dashboard for a VM. Add CPU usage and Network traffic charts.

Lesson 3.3 ‚Äì Log Analytics & Application Insights

Log Analytics: A powerful query tool that lets you search and analyze logs. Example: "Show me all errors in the last 24 hours."

Application Insights: Monitors applications directly (especially web apps). It gives response times, error rates, and even where users are accessing from.

üëâ Analogy:

Log Analytics = detective searching through case files (logs).

Application Insights = CCTV cameras monitoring your application‚Äôs every move.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube:

Enable Application Insights on a sample web app.

Show live metrics like response time and failed requests.

Run a Log Analytics query to filter logs.

Lesson 3.4 ‚Äì Creating Alerts & Notifications

Alerts are the proactive part of monitoring. Instead of you constantly watching dashboards, Azure will notify you when something is wrong.

Alerts can be triggered by metrics (e.g., CPU > 80%), logs (e.g., too many errors), or activity (e.g., a resource deleted).

Notifications can be sent via email, SMS, or integrated with tools like Teams and PagerDuty.

üëâ SRE Note: Alerts must be carefully tuned. Too many alerts = noise. Too few alerts = you miss incidents.

üëâ Demo idea for YouTube:

Set up an alert for a VM when CPU > 70%.

Trigger the alert (e.g., run a stress test on VM).

Show email notification arriving.

‚úÖ At the end of Module 3, learners will:

Understand observability basics.

Use Azure Monitor for dashboards.

Explore logs with Log Analytics.

Monitor apps with Application Insights.

Configure alerts to stay proactive.

This gives them the real-world monitoring skills every SRE must have.

## Module 4: Keeping Systems Reliable
Lesson 4.1 ‚Äì What is Reliability? (SLI, SLO, SLA explained simply)

Reliability means your system does what it‚Äôs supposed to, all the time. In SRE, we define it using three key terms:

SLA (Service Level Agreement): The official promise to customers (e.g., ‚Äú99.9% uptime‚Äù).

SLO (Service Level Objective): Internal target for reliability (e.g., ‚ÄúSystem response < 2 seconds‚Äù).

SLI (Service Level Indicator): The actual measurement (e.g., ‚ÄúAverage response time = 1.8 seconds‚Äù).

üëâ Analogy: Imagine a pizza delivery service.

SLA = ‚ÄúWe promise delivery within 30 minutes.‚Äù

SLO = ‚ÄúOur goal is to deliver in 25 minutes.‚Äù

SLI = ‚ÄúAverage delivery time is 22 minutes.‚Äù

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea: Create a slide or simple graphic to explain SLA/SLO/SLI. Use a real-world example like a web app uptime chart.

Lesson 4.2 ‚Äì High Availability in Azure (Availability Zones & Sets)

Azure provides built-in features for keeping systems up even if something fails:

Availability Zones: Physically separate datacenters in the same region. If one fails, traffic goes to another.

Availability Sets: Grouping VMs so they‚Äôre spread across multiple servers ‚Äî preventing downtime if one server crashes.

üëâ Beginner Example: Think of power backup at home. If one power line fails, the backup keeps lights on.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea: Show creating a VM inside an Availability Set and explain how Azure distributes them.

Lesson 4.3 ‚Äì Load Balancers & Auto-Scaling

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple servers so no single one is overloaded.

Azure Traffic Manager: Routes users to the closest or healthiest datacenter.

Auto-Scaling: Automatically increases/decreases the number of VMs or app instances based on demand.

üëâ Analogy: Think of a restaurant with multiple chefs. Load balancer = head waiter sending orders to different chefs. Auto-scaling = hiring extra chefs when it gets busy.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea: Deploy two VMs with a simple web page and use Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Show how requests go to both servers.

Lesson 4.4 ‚Äì Backup & Disaster Recovery (DR) Basics

Even with high availability, failures can happen. That‚Äôs why we need backups and disaster recovery.

Backup: Copy of your data/resources stored separately.

Disaster Recovery (DR): Entire system recovery in another location if the primary one fails.

Azure provides services like Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery.

üëâ Beginner Example: Think of your phone. You back up photos to the cloud. If your phone is lost (disaster), you can restore them to a new phone.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea:

Enable Azure Backup for a VM.

Delete a file on that VM.

Show how to restore it from backup.

‚úÖ By the end of Module 4, learners will:

Clearly understand SLA, SLO, and SLI.

Build systems that stay up during failures.

Use Load Balancers and Auto-Scaling for resilience.

Protect data and apps with Backup and DR strategies.

This module gives them real-world skills that companies expect from SREs in Azure environments.

## Module 5: Automation & DevOps for Beginners
Lesson 5.1 ‚Äì Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC: ARM, Bicep, Terraform)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means you define infrastructure (VMs, networks, storage) using code instead of clicking in the Azure portal.

ARM Templates: JSON files for Azure resources.

Bicep: A simpler, human-friendly language for ARM.

Terraform: Popular open-source tool that works across multiple clouds.

üëâ Analogy: Manual deployment is like cooking without a recipe (hard to repeat). IaC is like having a recipe ‚Äî you can repeat it anytime with the same result.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea: Show a simple Bicep file that creates a storage account, then deploy it using Azure CLI.

Lesson 5.2 ‚Äì Azure CLI & PowerShell Basics for Automation

Instead of always using the Azure Portal, you can use command-line tools:

Azure CLI: Cross-platform tool (Linux, Mac, Windows). Example:

az vm create --name TestVM --resource-group MyRG


Azure PowerShell: Best for Windows admins, integrates deeply with scripts.

üëâ Beginner Example: Creating 10 VMs in the portal = 10 minutes of clicking. With CLI/PowerShell, it‚Äôs a single command.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea: Create a VM using CLI and show the difference in speed vs the portal.

Lesson 5.3 ‚Äì Getting Started with Azure DevOps (Pipelines Explained Simply)

Azure DevOps is Microsoft‚Äôs platform for CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery).

CI (Continuous Integration): Developers push code ‚Üí automated tests run.

CD (Continuous Delivery): Code automatically deployed to Azure resources.

Pipeline: A set of steps that run automatically.

üëâ Analogy: Think of a factory line. Raw material goes in ‚Üí machines (pipeline steps) process it ‚Üí final product (app deployed).

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea:

Create a new Azure DevOps project.

Set up a simple pipeline to deploy an app to Azure App Service.

Show how pushing code triggers an automatic deployment.

Lesson 5.4 ‚Äì Automating Deployments with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is another way to automate builds and deployments. It‚Äôs popular because many developers already use GitHub.

You define workflows in a YAML file.

Can trigger on push, pull request, or schedule.

Can deploy apps directly to Azure.

üëâ SRE Note: GitHub Actions is great for small teams and open-source projects, while Azure DevOps is often used by enterprises.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea:

Create a GitHub repo with a sample web app.

Add a GitHub Action to deploy it to Azure App Service.

Push code and show automatic deployment happening.

‚úÖ By the end of Module 5, learners will:

Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with ARM, Bicep, and Terraform.

Use Azure CLI & PowerShell for automation.

Build simple pipelines in Azure DevOps.

Automate deployments with GitHub Actions.

This makes them job-ready, because most companies expect SREs to know automation and DevOps basics.

## Module 6: Security & Cost Management
Lesson 6.1 ‚Äì Security Best Practices Every SRE Must Know

As an SRE, one of your main responsibilities is to make sure systems are secure from day one. In Azure, this means:

Least Privilege Access: Give users the minimum permissions they need.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Always secure logins with an extra layer.

Encrypt Data: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.

Regular Updates: Keep VMs and services patched.

üëâ Analogy: Think of a house.

Least privilege = only giving guests access to the living room, not your bedroom.

MFA = locking the door + security camera check.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea: Show enabling MFA in the Azure portal and demonstrate how it works during login.

Lesson 6.2 ‚Äì Using Azure Security Center & Defender

Azure Security Center (also called Microsoft Defender for Cloud) is a dashboard that gives security recommendations and detects threats.

Identifies misconfigurations (e.g., open ports, weak passwords).

Provides a Secure Score to track your environment‚Äôs security level.

Can integrate with threat detection (Defender for Servers, Defender for Apps).

üëâ SRE Note: This is your ‚Äúmission control‚Äù for security. Companies rely on it to prevent breaches.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea:

Open Security Center in Azure.

Show a Secure Score.

Fix one recommendation (e.g., enable endpoint protection).

Lesson 6.3 ‚Äì Network Security Groups & Firewalls

Azure protects resources with built-in network security:

Network Security Groups (NSG): Rules that allow or deny traffic to subnets/VMs.

Azure Firewall: A managed firewall for larger networks.

DDoS Protection: Helps prevent denial-of-service attacks.

üëâ Analogy:

NSG = door locks on individual rooms.

Azure Firewall = the security gate at the entrance.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea:

Create an NSG with rules allowing only SSH (port 22).

Try accessing with a blocked port and show that it fails.

Lesson 6.4 ‚Äì Cost Monitoring & Budget Alerts in Azure

Security is important, but so is cost management. Azure charges based on usage, so costs can grow quickly if not monitored.

Cost Analysis: Breaks down spend by service (VMs, Storage, etc.).

Budgets: Set spending limits (e.g., $50/month).

Alerts: Get notified when costs approach the budget.

üëâ Analogy: Think of it like using a prepaid mobile plan. You want alerts before the balance runs out.

üëâ YouTube Demo Idea:

Show the Cost Analysis dashboard.

Create a Budget of $10.

Trigger a spending alert by creating a resource.

‚úÖ By the end of Module 6, learners will:

Apply best security practices in Azure.

Use Security Center & Defender to protect environments.

Configure NSGs & Firewalls for safe networking.

Monitor costs and set alerts to avoid overspending.

This ensures they know how to keep systems both secure and affordable ‚Äî two skills that make SREs valuable to any company.
